# This is Friometry!
## What is Friometry?
Friometry is my (Lukas Friman) geometry library that I've created for fun, mostly in attempt to learn how to properly establish a public library. I realize that there are 1000s upon 1000s of geometry libraries in all languages you could dream of, but this is my own little diamond, written in the most trustworthy language of them all, Rust.

## What makes Friometry different from any other libraries?
Nothing, probably. I do some cool things, but in all honesty all things in this library can be achieved easily with lots of other things. I just try to make it all as neatly packed and packaged as possible. :)
